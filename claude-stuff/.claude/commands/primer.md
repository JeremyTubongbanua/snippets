# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the command `ls` or `tree` to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start by reading the CLAUDE.md file, and any nested CLAUDE.md files if you are going to be dwelling in that location to get a good understanding.

Read the README.md file to get an understanding of the project.

IMPORTANT: Use Serena MCP to search through code base. If you get any errors, try with different Serena tools.

Explain back to me:

- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Any important dependencies
- Any important configuration files
